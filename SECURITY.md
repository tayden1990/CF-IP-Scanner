## Security Best Practices for Users

1. **Enable TLS Verification** — Always enable "Strict TLS" in advanced settings to prevent MITM attacks
2. **Keep Updated** — Use the latest version for security patches
3. **Verify Downloads** — Only download from the official GitHub repository
4. **Config Privacy** — Your VLESS configs are processed locally and never uploaded
